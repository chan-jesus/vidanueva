This is going to be a generic church website program.

At the moment, it's just a website for my church.

It's written in c++, and depends on wt-3.1.8 and mongodb.

Todo:

 * Login for members
 * Bilingual editing (as my church is Spanish speaking)
 * Upload Sermon mp3s
 * Special cellphone version automagic
 * Rostering (cleaning, music, kitchen, etc.)

Open to other ideas ..
