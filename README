This is going to be a generic church website program.

At the moment, it's just a website for my church.

It's written in c++, and depends on wt-3.1.8 and mongodb.

Todo:

 * Login for members
 * Bilingual editing (as my church is Spanish speaking)
 * Upload Sermon mp3s
 * Special cellphone version automagic
 * Rostering (cleaning, music, kitchen, etc.)

Open to other ideas ..

How Sessions Work
=================

So witty has sessions, they are for a single WApplication instance.

We have another session cookie, for logged in users.

When a user is logged in we consider WApplications to be just views onto a larger logged in session.

There's a singleton, thread safe store that hooks together cookies with logged in usernames.

Each VidaApp (our application instance) holds a 'SessionHandle'. So if a user is logged in on one tab, they're logged in
on both tabs.

If they just type in a url in the browser bar, it'll create a new VidaApp instance, that'll check the session store
using their browser's session cookie.

Timeout is handled on the server side .. default is 30 mins right now .. if you use the app during the 30 mins, it
should reset the session cookie. The actual client side cookie timeout is really really long, like a month I think,
but it won't do you any good unless the server side has it hooked up to a logged in username.
